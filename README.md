Subject: Data Quality Issues and Next Steps

Hi team,

I've been analyzing the brand, receipt, and user data, and I've found some data quality issues that we need to address before moving forward with building our data warehouse.

Here's a summary of the issues I found:

Duplicate user data: There are many duplicate entries in the user data, which could skew our analysis and reporting.
Inconsistent brand names: Some brand names contain special characters and inconsistencies, making it difficult to analyze and compare them.
Invalid dates: Some dates in the receipt and user data are invalid, which could affect our ability to track trends and patterns over time.
Inconsistent data entry: There are inconsistencies in how some fields are populated, such as the "topBrand" flag and the "rewardsReceiptStatus" field.
To resolve these issues and optimize our data assets, I'd like to propose the following:

Data cleaning: We need to clean the data by removing duplicates, standardizing brand names, and correcting invalid dates.
Data validation rules: We should implement data validation rules to prevent future data quality issues.
Data governance: We need to establish clear data governance policies and procedures to ensure data quality and consistency.
To help me with this, I'd like to know:

What is the business process for collecting and managing this data?
Are there any existing data quality rules or guidelines?
What are the business requirements for data accuracy and completeness?
Performance and Scaling Considerations:

I anticipate that the data warehouse will grow significantly over time, so we need to design it for scalability.
We also need to consider performance optimization techniques, such as indexing and partitioning, to ensure fast query response times.
I'm confident that by addressing these data quality issues and optimizing our data assets, we can build a robust and reliable data warehouse that will support our business goals.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,

Ugo Asoluka
